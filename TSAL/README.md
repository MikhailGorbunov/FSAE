# TSAL
A comparator-based TSAL design for FSAE Electric 2019
*This repo is for the design of a system required in the Formula SAE competition 2019, and so will use common nomenclature specified in the [2019 rules v2.1](http://www.fsaeonline.com/cdsweb/gen/DocumentResources.aspx)*

The *Tractive System Active Light* is a red/green indicator light that indicates the presence of high-voltage in the Tractive System. The following design for a TSAL driver is split across two modules. The High-Voltage Measurement module (HVM) and the Indicator Module (DRV). The HVM connects to the output of the AIRs, and is located in the accumulator housing. The HVM is responsible for detecting whether Tractive System voltage is above or below the safe threshold.

## System Overview

## High-Voltage Measurement (HVM)
![](TSAL-HVM/render.png)

The HVM is located in the accumulator and measures the TS-voltage. The status of the TS-voltage is output by a open-collector style output (switched relay contact to ground).

The HVM has been designed to mount above the IMD, using the same mounting-hole dimensions. This will likely require conformal coating of the board and an intermediate insulating material to meet regulation EV.6.1.5 and EV.6.1.7

The HVM is designed to **not** be user adjustable. Resistive dividers R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5, R6, R7 may be used to set the trigger threshold for the onboard comparator. As specified, the board should safely handle 400V at the HV inputs (untested). Diode D1 begins conducting when approximately 200V is present at HV inputs - effectively limiting the input voltage of the comparator.

### Assembly notes
Many parts of the v1 design are provisional.
**ToDo - assembly instructions**

### Design justification
A comparator circuit was chosen because they are relatively simple to design, are well understood and behave predictably.
An isolated power supply U1 is powered by the GLV (12V) and provides an isolated 12V supply for this circuit.

R1, R2, R3, R4 form an input voltage divider which scales the input (0-200V -> 0-12V). The voltage divider is split between multiple resistors to keep the voltage across each resistor manageable. Since each 1208 package is rated for 200VDC this topology is theoretically capable of measuring up to 400VDC. This range can be trivially increased with the addition of more resistors in the divider.

R5, R6, R7 form a resistive divider that provides a stable voltage reference of 3V for the comparator. A resistive divider was chosen over a zener voltage reference because the output of the DC-DC converter U1 should be accurate and stable enough for this application.

With the values chosen, the output of the comparator should be HIGH while input voltage is less than 60V. The output should be LOW for input voltages greater than 60V.

R9, R8, C2 form an input filter for the comparator which is prescribed in the LM311 datasheet. This prevents noise coupling from the output to the input.

R10 is included to provide hysteresis. Since hysteresis is symmetric in this circuit, it is chosen to be small so as not to significantly offset the actual switching threshold from the desired threshold.

N-Channel MOSFET, Q1 and relay K1 form the isolated output of the circuit. While the input voltage is less than 60V, R11 pulls-up the gate of Q1, energising the relay coil and closing the contacts. D3 is a status indicator and D4 is a flyback diode.

The action of Q1 is inverted in Q2 and Q3, which drive an on-board status indicator LED and an off-board status indicator respectively.

To comply with FSAE rules the voltage systems on board are galvanically isolated. The clearances on-board require it to be conformal coated.

### Failure Modes - Fail Unsafe
 - Should the output of comparator U2 become disabled, R12 will continually pull the gate of Q1 high, energising the relay coil and indicating that a safe voltage is present.
 - If J1 is disconnected the TSAL will continually indicate a safe voltage is present - regardless of whether this is true or not.

These failure modes are clearly undesirable but deemed an acceptable risk for a first-revision TSAL. No publicly available design was found from competing teams that addressed these limitations.
The reasons these modes are fail-unsafe is due to the action of the comparator: The particular comparator chosen (LM311) has an open-collector output which must be accompanied by a pullup resistor. Since the switching action of the comparator pulls the output low and is capable of driving a relay directly, a suggested improvement is to either drive the relay coil directly (which also inverts the output action). This would reduce the parts count, removing Q1 from the BOM and reduce the number of critical components. Alternatively, a comparator with a push-pull output could be selected and directly substituted for U2.

### Failure Modes - Fail Safe
 - Should the TSAL-HVM lose power, the coil of relay K1 will be de-energised and its contacts will open. This will continually signal that dangerous voltage is present in the Tractive System. While that may not necessarily be true, the implausible behaviour of the TSAL should alert engineers that a fault is present: Either the AIRs are stuck closed, the Tractive System capacitors are remaining charged or a fault is present in the TSAL. All of these plausible causes should warrant due caution.

### Recommendations
There is significant room for improvement of the TSAL-HVM as made clear by the failure modes listed above. Here I will outline a brief description of how one might address what I consider to be the most serious limitation: The tendency to indicate safe-voltage if the TSAL-HVM is disconnected from the Tractive System.

If one can assume that the Tractive System is always capacitive (large capacitors at the motor driver power-input) then the HVM may be redesigned to check for the presence of capacitance at its measurement terminals using the Grounded Specimen Test method.

## Indicator module (DRV)
The Indicator module is powered by the GLVS and controls the behaviour of the red/green TSAL. It is controlled by a single input which is pulled low by the action of the HVM. Each output channel is capable of several amps and should be suitable for driving 12V LED assemblies or even incandescent bulbs.

### Design Notes
The heart of the driver module is the complementary operation of the timer (U1) and the P-Channel MOSFET (Q1). The VHI signal effectively selects which of these components should be active.

When VHI (J2) is pulled to ground, Q1 switches on - driving VLO indicator LED (D2) and powering the offboard, green TSAL LEDs (J1). A low signal at VHI also holds the reset pin of the U1 low, disabling its output.

When VHI is floating (the output-relay on HVM is open), R2 pulls-up the gate of Q1, turning off Q1. The RESET pin of U1 is also pulled-up, activating U1 which oscillates at approx. 3Hz, oscillating Q2 which flashes VHI LED (D1) and the off-board red TSAL LEDs (J1).

Power to the TSAL-DRV is unregulated, since all components are sufficiently robust to handle power deviations from the expected 12V.

### Known issues
The two power MOSFETs are a little close together. So close in fact that they could feasibly touch given the tolerances of fasteners and 3.2mm drilled holes.
Nothing should be *immediately* damaged if the tabs of the MOSFETs touch. However, any difference in switching time will cause momentary high-current through both transistors whenever the state of VHI changes. This is because the MOSFET drains will be connected together so there will be a momentary current path from GLV+ through Q1, Q2, to ground during any overlap in switching time.

Operation of the red/green circuit blocks are not *strictly* â€‹complementary. It is feasible that some analogue voltage could be applied at VHI which would allow both red and green components of the TSAL to be active. This is not a concern under the prescribed operating conditions. The operation could trivially be made strictly complementary by including input conditioning to VHI.
