# Precharge Source Code

There are several code projects here, each maturing as the prototype is commissioned.
The library source files have evolved as the prototype evolves - eg. measurements.cpp
from one project will not be the same as another.

## Projects listed by maturity
- [v-f-experiment](v-f-experiment/) Used to measure the characteristics of V-F converters
- [log-voltage](log-voltage/) Using the data obtained in the v-f expermiment to log voltage information
for TS and Accumulator in a precharge bench-experiment
