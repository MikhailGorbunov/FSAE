# V-F characterisation

This program is for performing the V-F characterisation experiment.

### How to perform the experiment
- Apply voltage at `SchematicRef: TP5 and TP6` from 0 to 10V
- Record the frequencies that are logged to the console
- Perform linear fits to the collected data: y = mx + b
- Populate the relevant constants in the main program with the linear-fit constants you found in the previous step.
