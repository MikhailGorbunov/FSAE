# Precharge

A device to precharge the Tractive System. This prototype features voltage feedback to protect AIRs. In open-loop systems, if a wiring fault develops (eg. precharge resistor is disconnected or discharge is stuck on) then the precharge is ineffective and AIRs may become damaged.

## Operation
A brief description of the Precharge logic follows. Refer to *Figures 2 & 3* for state-flow information.
- Initialise in `State: Standby` and monitor for a stable Shutdown Circuit.
- If Shutdown Circuit is stable, enter `State: Precharge`:
 - Close the precharge relay
 - Monitor Accumulator voltage and Tractive System voltage
 - Once TSV is close enough to AV (eg >95%), precharge is complete
 - If precharge is too fast or too slow, a fault is likely present eg. Wiring fault, discharge stuck-on, stuck relay.
- If precharge completed with no errors, proceed to `State: Online`:
 - Enable the AIR, open precharge relay

If at any point the Shutdown Circuit voltage becomes too low, enter `State: Standby`

## Recommendations after building prototype

**V-F Conversion**: Either include offset in V-F converter circuit so that min frequency is eg ~100Hz instead of 0Hz ([Datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm331.pdf): Figure 14) or replace V-F converters with microcontroller programmed for the same task. The challenge is that low frequencies require a long timeout period. Applying a 100Hz offset means the longest timeout would be 10 milli-seconds.
