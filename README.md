Watch a [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/bgW9xbbovIY) explaining the circuit operation and design decision.

## [Precharge](Precharge)
A device to precharge the Tractive System. This prototype features voltage feedback to protect AIRs. In open-loop systems, if a wiring fault develops - eg. precharge resistor is disconnected - then the precharge is ineffective and AIRs may become damaged.
